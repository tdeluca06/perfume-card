While building this project, I took a mobile-first design approach for the first time in order to create a truly responsive web page that displays well on all screen sizes. I had my first experience properly utilizing both a flex and a grid in the same layout, and I used media queries for the first time. I also decided to add an easing-in animation on my own in the hover state as I thought it improved quality. The biggest challenge was definitely desiging with a mobile-first mindset. I learned proper CSS reset techniques to create responsive layouts and I learned about locally scoped variables that can be used in containers. I improved my naming by following the BEM naming convention in HTML and organized my CSS code in a way that makes it easier to maintain and adjust through use of local and global variables, as compared to my previous projects.
